There are different ways to run the app. 

1. Install Node.js 
install expo using 'npm install expo-cli --global' in terminal while in project directory 
'npm i' should download all necessary dependencies (in terminal while in project directory )
use 'expo start' to run the app (in terminal while in project directory )
downloading the expo go app to your phone will allow you to use the app on your phone
you must be connected to the same wifi as the device 

2. use online simulator with link:

 (this way is less responsive and very laggy but will have no hassle setting up)
